<p>I just finished my PhD in Electrical Engineering and Computer Science at the University of California, Berkeley where I was co-advised by 
<a href="https://www.mrtz.org/">Moritz Hardt</a> and <a href="https://www.stat.berkeley.edu/~bartlett/">Peter Bartlett</a>. Starting Fall 2023, I will 
be a postdoctoral fellow at the Harvard Center for Research on Computation and Society hosted by <a href="https://seas.harvard.edu/person/cynthia-dwork">Cynthia Dwork</a>.
I also did my undergrad in CS and Math at Harvard.
	
<p> Researchwise, I'm interested in the foundations of machine learning in society. During my PhD, I worked on developing the theory behind performative 
prediction and understanding the feedback loops that arise when algorithmic predictions inform social decision-making. Recently, I did some 
<a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2304.06205.pdf">empirical work</a> on 
evaluating risk prediction algorithms in Wisconsin Public Schools. 
More generally, I'm also interested in reinforcement learning, control theory, and machine 
learning in dynamic environments.

<p> I was born and raised in San Juan, Puerto Rico. Before becoming interested in research, I was part of the Puerto Rican national team in sailing. I won the island's first gold medal at the 2013 Youth World
	Championships and represented Puerto Rico at the 2015 Pan American Games. Also, I was fortunate to be a part of Emirates Team New Zealand's winning campaign
	for the 35th America's Cup.
