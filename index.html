	<p>I am a first year graduate student in Computer Science at the University of California, Berkeley where I am co-advised by 
<a href="https://www.moritzhardt.com/">Moritz Hardt</a> and <a href="https://www.stat.berkeley.edu/~bartlett/">Peter Bartlett</a>. Before
coming to Berkeley, I did my undergrad in CS and Math at Harvard where I was lucky to work with
<a href="https://people.seas.harvard.edu/~yaron/">Yaron Singer</a>.</p>

<p> Researchwise, I'm interested in the theory behind machine learning and understanding ways of making current algorithms more reliable
	for real world applications. More generally, my research lies somewhere around learning theory, statistics, optimization, and game theory.</p>

<p> Before becoming interested in research, I was part of the Puerto Rican national team in sailing. I won the island's first gold medal at the 2013 Youth World
	Championships and represented Puerto Rico at the 2015 Pan American Games. Also, I was fortunate to be a part of Emirates Team New Zealand's winning campaign
	for the 35th America's Cup.
