      My research develops foundations of machine learning for the social world. 
      I study the feedback loops that arise between people and algorithms, and develop methods with provable guarantees in these dynamic, social contexts.
      <br><br>
      I earned my PhD in EECS from UC Berkeley, and my BA in CS and Math from Harvard. 
      I was previously a CRCS postdoctoral fellow at Harvard and am spending this year as a postdoc at MIT.<br><br>

    <h3>Research Overview</h3>
    <p>I organize my work around a mix of both theoretical and empirically driven directions. These include,</p>
    
    <p><strong>Performative Prediction:</strong>
    When we use predictions to inform decisions about people, these predictions don't just change the future: they actively shape it. 
    Traffic predictions shape traffic patterns and economic forecasts influence market prices. 
    Performative prediction is a learning theoretic
    framework we developed to understand learning in these settings.

    </ul>
    </p>

      
    <p><strong>Prediction in Resource Allocation:</strong> 
      Faced with pressure to modernize, large bureaucracies -- such as education and labor departments -- are increasingly using statistical tools to target their interventions efficiently. 
      How do we prove that our prediction algorithms lead to efficient allocations? When is a prediction system "good enough" in these settings? 
      My work in this area changed how the Wisconsin Department of Public Instruction assigned interventions to over 200k students each year.

      </ul>
    </p>
    More generally, I am also interested in <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.11848">learning theory</a>, optimization, and sequential decision making.
