<p> I am a postdoctoral fellow at the Harvard Center for Research on Computation and Society hosted by <a href="https://seas.harvard.edu/person/cynthia-dwork">Cynthia Dwork</a>.
I finished my PhD in EECS at the University of California, Berkeley where I was co-advised by 
<a href="https://www.stat.berkeley.edu/~bartlett/">Peter Bartlett</a> and <a href="https://www.mrtz.org/">Moritz Hardt</a>.

<p> My research centers on machine learning in social systems, exploring how predictive systems can be used both to detect and shape social patterns.
I organize my work around a mix of both theory and empirically driven directions, including performative prediction and the study of prediction in resource allocation problems. 
Some representative papers of mine are,

<a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2002.06673">Performative Prediction</a>

<a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2304.06205">Difficult Lessons on Social Prediction from Wisconsin Public Schools</a>

<a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2312.08511">The Relative Value of Prediction in Algorithmic Decision Making</a>

<p> I was born and raised in San Juan, Puerto Rico. Before becoming interested in research, I was part of the Puerto Rican national sailing team. I won youth world championships at the under-17, 19, and 21 levels and represented Puerto Rico at the 2015 Pan American Games. Also, I was also part of Emirates Team New Zealand's winning campaign
for the 35th America's Cup in Bermuda.
