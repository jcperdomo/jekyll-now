  <div class="title">Postdoctoral Fellow @ Harvard<br>Incoming Assistant Professor @ NYU</div>
</div>


<p> I am currently a postdoctoral fellow at the Harvard Center for Research on Computation and Society hosted by <a href="https://seas.harvard.edu/person/cynthia-dwork">Cynthia Dwork</a>.
Starting in the fall of 2026, I will be an assistant professor of computer science and data science at NYU. 
</p>  
  
</p>  
<em>I will be actively looking for students and postdocs this upcoming application cycle (25'/26').</em>
</p>  

<p> <b>Research Overview.</b> My research focuses on the foundations of machine learning systems that make predictions or decisions about people.
I organize my work around a mix of both theoretical and empirically driven directions. These include performative prediction and the study of prediction in resource allocation problems. 
</p>

<p> <b>About.</b> I earned my PhD in EECS from UC Berkeley, where I was co-advised by 
<a href="https://www.stat.berkeley.edu/~bartlett/">Peter Bartlett</a> and <a href="https://www.mrtz.org/">Moritz Hardt</a>, and my BA in CS and Math from Harvard.
</p>

<p>  
I am from San Juan, <a href="images/atardecer_en_rincon.jpg">Puerto Rico</a> where I was on the national <a href="images/garda2.JPG">sailing</a> team. 
I won youth world championships at the under-17, 19, and 21 levels and represented Puerto Rico at the 2015 Pan American Games. I also worked on the design team during Emirates Team New Zealand's winning campaign
for the 35th America's Cup in Bermuda.
