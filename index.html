<p> I am a postdoctoral fellow at the Harvard Center for Research on Computation and Society hosted by <a href="https://seas.harvard.edu/person/cynthia-dwork">Cynthia Dwork</a>.
I finished my PhD in Electrical Engineering and Computer Science at the University of California, Berkeley where I was co-advised by 
<a href="https://www.stat.berkeley.edu/~bartlett/">Peter Bartlett</a> and <a href="https://www.mrtz.org/">Moritz Hardt</a>.

<p> My research centers on the foundations of machine learning and its uses in social decision-making. 
These papers are representative of my current interests:

<p>
	<a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2304.06205.pdf">Difficult Lessons on Social Prediction from Wisconsin Public Schools</a>
</p>
<p>
	<a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2210.01745.pdf">Making Decisions under Outcome Performativity</a>
</p>
<p>
	<a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2002.06673.pdf">Performative Prediction</a>
</p>

<p> I am from San Juan, Puerto Rico. Before becoming interested in research, I was part of the Puerto Rican national team in sailing. I won the island's first gold medal at the 2013 Youth World
	Championships and represented Puerto Rico at the 2015 Pan American Games. Also, I was fortunate to be a part of Emirates Team New Zealand's winning campaign
	for the 35th America's Cup.
