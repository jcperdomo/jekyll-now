<p>I am a third year graduate student in Computer Science at the University of California, Berkeley where I am co-advised by 
<a href="https://www.mrtz.org/">Moritz Hardt</a> and <a href="https://www.stat.berkeley.edu/~bartlett/">Peter Bartlett</a>. Before
coming to Berkeley, I did my undergrad in CS and Math at Harvard where I was lucky to work with
<a href="https://people.seas.harvard.edu/~yaron/">Yaron Singer</a>.</p>

<p> Researchwise, I'm interested in the foundations of machine learning. I am supported in part by a Graduate Research Fellowship from the National Science Foundation. 
</p>

<p> Before becoming interested in research, I was part of the Puerto Rican national team in sailing. I won the island's first gold medal at the 2013 Youth World
	Championships and represented Puerto Rico at the 2015 Pan American Games. Also, I was fortunate to be a part of Emirates Team New Zealand's winning campaign
	for the 35th America's Cup.
