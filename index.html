<p> I am a postdoctoral fellow at the Harvard Center for Research on Computation and Society hosted by <a href="https://seas.harvard.edu/person/cynthia-dwork">Cynthia Dwork</a>.
I received my PhD in EECS from UC Berkeley, where I was co-advised by 
<a href="https://www.stat.berkeley.edu/~bartlett/">Peter Bartlett</a> and <a href="https://www.mrtz.org/">Moritz Hardt</a>, and my BA in CS and Math from Harvard.
</p>  

<p> My research centers on machine learning in social systems, exploring how learning algorithms can be used both to detect and shape social patterns.
I organize my work around a mix of both theory and empirically driven directions, including performative prediction and the study of prediction in resource allocation problems. 
Some representative papers:

<p> I was born and raised in San Juan, <a href="images/atardecer_en_rincon.jpg">Puerto Rico</a> where I was on the national <a href="images/garda2.jpg">sailing</a> team. 
I won youth world championships at the under-17, 19, and 21 levels and represented Puerto Rico at the 2015 Pan American Games. I also worked on the design team during Emirates Team New Zealand's winning campaign
for the 35th America's Cup in Bermuda.
